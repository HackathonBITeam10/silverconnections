                <p>
                    FaceTime is a built in application on all Apple products (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Mac)
                    As long as you are connected to the internet, you can stay in touch with family and friends.
                    The advantage of Facetime is you can chat with anyone in the world, without a long distance plan.
                    Facetime can also be used for audio or video calls.
