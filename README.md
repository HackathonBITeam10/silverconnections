This is an instructional website aimed at elderly users that will outline how to use video communications technologies such as Zoom, Skype, Face time and messaging applications. It is designed to be fully responsive across a range of devices and incorporating simple design features to ensure visitors ease of use.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand how to use and navigate the site.

        1. On first viewing the site, users are introduced to the main image and header outlining how the site intends to help the user.
        2. The video communications tools listed are easily identified using interactive cards.
        3. The user intuitively understands that the content of the site continues down the page and all they have to do is to scroll to find the information that they are looking for.

    2.  As a First Time Visitor, I want the site to be designed simply, without ambiguous language and with clear and concise guiding prompts to find the content I am looking for.

        1. Each page on the site explains in precise, simplistic language what a user must do to navigate the site.
        2. On each card it is explained that a user must click to interact with the content in order to view the tutorial on how to use the specific technology. 
        3. Within each card there are simplistic step-by-step guides on how to download, sign up for and use the technologies included. There are also short embedded videos on how to use the selected video communications technology.

    3.  As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the sites purpose.
        1. From the header on the top of the home page, a user will clearly understand what the sites purpose is from the short introduction of the sites purpose.
        2. Further information relating to the sites purpose will be evident from the description of the technologies listed using cards and a following explanation of each card containing a "How To" on using the technology.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to refresh my understanding of how to use the technologies listed on the site.

        1. The content is laid out in a simplistic manner that a returning user should have no problems refreshing their knowledge on how to use the site.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to navigate with ease throughout the entire site.

        1. A frequent user will be comfortable in navigating the site. Therefore no major design changes should be implemented to the original layout of the page.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to learn about any new video communications technologies added to the site.

        1. Any new additional technologies will be clearly outlined so a user who is not familiar with them will be able to learn more only a click away.

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to be able to request new "How To's" be added to the site for a new technology I have heard about.
        1. Perhaps a frequent user has heard of a new video communications technology and wants to learn more about it.
        2. However there are no "How To" guides availble that suit the users needs.
        3. The user should then be able to contact us and request we do a "How To" on the technology they are curious about.

### Further Testing

-   The website was tested across all major web browsers including Google Chrome, Brave, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Intenet Explorer.
-   The website was tested across various devices such as Android and iPhone mobile phones, Tablets, Desktops and laptops to ensure it's responsiveness.
-   Detailed testing was conducted on all interactive links on the site to ensure their functionality.
-   Members of the Slack Community, family and friends were invited to test the website and to give their feedback on functionality and potential bugs.

### Known Bugs

-  Images are not showing up on other.html and will be fixed asap.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

Forking the GitHub Repository allows us to make a copy of the Original Repository. This allows a user to open the repositiory and to view and make changes without affecting the original. 
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and go to the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HackathonBITeam10/silverconnections)
2. Below the top right of the page under the Navbar, click on the "Fork" button.
3. A copy of the original repository has now been added to your GitHub account.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
